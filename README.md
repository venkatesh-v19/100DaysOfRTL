# 100DaysOfRTL

Welcome to the **100 Days of RTL** repository! This project is a structured learning journey focusing on **RTL (Register Transfer Level) design and simulation** using **Verilog HDL** and digital logic concepts. Each day covers a new concept, implementation, and simulation example to build strong practical and theoretical understanding in digital design.

---

## 📚 Objective
- Strengthen **digital design fundamentals**.
- Implement **RTL designs** from scratch.
- Simulate and verify **sequential and combinational circuits**.
- Document designs in a structured, shareable format for learning and career showcase.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- **HDL**: Verilog  
- **Simulation**: Xilinx ISE / Vivado  
- **Documentation**: GitHub Markdown  

---


- Each day has its **own folder** containing:
  - Verilog source code (`.v`)
  - Testbench for simulation
  - Simulation screenshots or waveform outputs

---

## 📌 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/venkatesh-v19/100DaysOfRTL.git
2. Open the desired day folder in Xilinx ISE/Vivado.
3. Compile and simulate the Verilog design.
4. Review testbench and waveform outputs for verification.

## ⚠️ Notes

- All designs are implemented in pure Verilog HDL.
- Focus is on learning, practicing, and documenting RTL concepts, not production-ready IP cores.
